My C Kernel

Welcome to my C-based kernel project! This is a learning experiment where I’m exploring how basic system booting works. While I’m no expert in C or assembly, I’ve managed to get a simple BIOS bootloader working. Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or contribute.
About the Project

This kernel is a minimal Unix-like system designed for learning. It’s not functional on real hardware yet but serves as a foundation for experimenting with system development.
Features

    Basic Bootloader in Assembly: A simple BIOS bootloader to initialize the system.
    Kernel Logic in C: Basic kernel code ready for expansion.
    Cross-Compilation Support: Build and run on multiple platforms.

How to Build and Run
On Windows

    Install:
        NASM: nasm.us
        GCC: gcc.gnu.org
        GNU LD: sourceware.org
        QEMU: qemu.org

    Build and run with:

    nasm -f elf32 kernel.asm -o kasm.o
    gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -c kernel.c -o kc.o
    ld -m elf_i386 -T link.ld -o kernel kasm.o kc.o
    qemu-system-i386 -kernel kernel

On Linux

    Install tools:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nasm gcc qemu-system-i386 binutils

Build and run with:

    nasm -f elf32 kernel.asm -o kasm.o
    gcc -m32 -c kernel.c -o kc.o
    ld -m elf_i386 -T link.ld -o kernel kasm.o kc.o
    qemu-system-i386 -kernel kernel

Project Structure

    kernel.asm: Bootloader written in assembly.
    kernel.c: Basic kernel logic in C.
    link.ld: Linker script to combine object files and set the load address.

Future Goals

    Add I/O support (keyboard and screen).
    Implement memory management.
    Introduce multitasking.
    Add file system support.
