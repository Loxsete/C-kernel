# C-kernel
My C-Kernel
I'm not a super person in C or assembler, I barely found the BIOS bootloader, so please don't hate me :)
I'm just trying to code shit
And now a little about the code, here is a similar Unix kernel, it doesn’t work on a real PC. If anyone wants, you can modify it, and I won’t mind.
